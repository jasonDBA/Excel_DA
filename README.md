# Excel-Data-Analytics
This is an output of a large dataset related to an international student enrollment at Centennial College. I went through this with MS Excel and mostly used Pivot table.

## Details
* The first bottom tap represents raw data including various attributes(columns).
* The second bottom tap named 'Confirmed(No duplicated)' is the dataset handled by data cleaning (removed duplicated records and filled a blank cell with proper values).
* The third bottom tap named 'TOTAL_Recruit' is organized outcomes sorted by countries and school programs. It involves in many meaningful results such as a subset of total students registered a course. Since it also includes the target number of students that management team expects in next semester, the data table helps determine how many more students will be enrolled in a particular program or from countries, or there are a large number of enrolled students, how much to reduce the number of target students for that program next semester.
* The fourth and fifth bottom tap named each 'By School' and 'By Team' are literally a summary of the data sorted by school programs and teams (category of countries).
